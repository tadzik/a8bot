+ Plugins more user-controlled:
	- The actual app something more than a8bot->new->run
	- Stuff like $obj->add_plugin()
	- Register plugins per keyword
		· less calling, only the wanted plugins get called
		· also no crap when 2 plugins start to respond
	- Maybe 3 types of plugins:
		· those responding on specified keywords
		· those responding when they want to (like all the plugins now)
		· those sitting passively and listening
		· combos? (seen would be 1st and 3rd)
+ Plugins are Moose roles
	- consumed by some Plugin object (Plugin object used in a8bot class, like now)
	- we use Moose anyway
	- more possibilities of plugins validation?
	- yay or nay?
+ Anything to add? I have to get back to my Maths
